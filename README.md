##re-starter

My starting point for creating a new cljs app :)

 - [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) as our React.js wrapper
 - [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for app structure
 - [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) for code reloading
 - [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) for visual dev environment
 - [bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) and [pushy](https://github.com/kibu-australia/pushy) for routing

Getting started:
 - [ ] run `rlwrap lein figwheel cards dev`
 - [ ] open `http://localhost:3449/cards.html` to see devcards
 - [ ] open `http://localhost:3449` to see your app
