##re-starter

My starting point for creating a new cljs app :)

 - [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) as our React.js wrapper
 - [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for app structure
 - [bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) and [pushy](https://github.com/kibu-australia/pushy) for routing
 - [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) for code reloading

Getting started:
 - [ ] run `lein repl`
 - [ ] `(fig)` to start up figwheel
 - [ ] open `http://localhost:3449/`
